WordPress staging sites made easy.

== Description ==

WP Stagecoach lets you create a staging copy of your WordPress site and merge your changes back to your live site.
Never develop on a live site again!

Key features:

* Create a staging copy of your live site with one click.
* Copy changes from your staging site back to your live site.
* Choose which changes to import. You can import some or all of your file changes, and/or your database changes.
* Password-protect your staging site.
* SFTP access to your staging site.
* Staging site runs on our server – no need to set up hosting for your staging site.
* Revert file changes if importing from your staging site doesn’t go as expected.
* SSL enabled on all staging sites.
